# **Problem Statement, Objectives, Contributions, and IMRaD Outline for AI-Driven Forecasting of COVID-19 Cases**

## **1. Problem Statement**
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical need for accurate and timely forecasting of case trends to inform public health interventions. Despite numerous studies employing AI-driven approaches, significant challenges remain, including issues of data quality, model generalizability across regions, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability of forecasts. This paper aims to systematically review and synthesize prior work in AI-driven forecasting of COVID-19 cases, identify existing gaps, and propose novel methodologies that enhance predictive capabilities and trust in model outputs.

## **2. Objectives**
- To systematically review and synthesize the literature on AI-driven forecasting methods for COVID-19 cases.
- To identify methodological patterns, key datasets, and the limitations faced by existing studies.
- To propose a new framework for AI-driven forecasting that addresses the identified gaps, focusing on uncertainty quantification, generalizability, and model interpretability.

## **3. Contributions**
- A comprehensive review of 56 peer-reviewed studies detailing AI methodologies used for COVID-19 forecasting.
- Identification of major gaps and challenges within the current research landscape.
- Proposal of a novel forecasting framework that integrates spatio-temporal modeling with explainable AI techniques and utilizes diverse datasets for improved predictions.
